The goal is to develop a software program that manages energy trading transactions in a smart grid environment. 
Energy trading transactions occur when energy producers (sellers) sell energy to consumers (buyers) at specified rates.
These transactions need to be accurately recorded, tracked, and analyzed to optimize energy trading operations, manage financial records, and enable efficient trading management within the grid.
The program will provide functionalities to handle energy trading transactions, each of which is represented by the following attributes:
1. Transaction ID: A unique identifier for each transaction.
2. Buyer ID: The unique ID of the entity buying energy.
3. Seller ID: The unique ID of the entity selling energy.
4. Amount of Energy (kWh): The amount of energy traded in kilowatt-hours.
5. Price per kWh: The price at which the energy is traded per kilowatt-hour.
6. Timestamp: The date and time when the transaction occurred.

   Operation which this is performing are:
        1. Add New Transaction
        2. Display All Transactions
        3. list of transaction of every seller
       4. Create a list of transactions for every buyer;
        5. Transactions in Time Period
        6. Month with Maximum Transactions in same year
        7. Total Revenue by Seller
        8. Sorting  list of seller according revenue generated
        9. Find and Display the Transaction with the Highest Energy Amount and Sort it accordig to energy amount
        10. Sorting  list of buyer according energy bought
        11. Find out a pair of seller/buyer involved in maximum number of transactions
        12. Sort all seller/buyer pairs in decreasing order of the number of transactions
        13. Sort all seller/buyer pairs in decreasing order of the total revenue generated  between them
